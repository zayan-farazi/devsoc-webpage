Keeping this up as a progress check:

Phase 1: - Create component for text - Manage state (learn about this) - define the interface for components - use references (should help with opposites attract theme)

Phase 2: - build the two half layout - use div blocks + bootstrap - customise colour palette

Phase 3: - rotate bottom half of page - implement reverse scrolling

Phase 4: - add a toggle button - reorder halves on toggle - apply colour inversion
